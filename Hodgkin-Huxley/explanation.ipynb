This means that different waveforms can meet the threshold through various combinations of amplitude and duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time-Dependent Ion Channel Kinetics: The kinetics of sodium (Na⁺) and potassium (K⁺) channels depend on the membrane potential over time. Different waveforms influence the rate at which ion channels open and close, affecting how quickly the neuron reaches an action potential threshold. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A square pulse delivers a quick, consistent current, rapidly depolarizing the membrane and triggering the channels.\n",
    "    - A sawtooth waveform gradually increases in amplitude, potentially allowing time for K⁺ channels to counteract Na⁺ entry, *possibly requiring a higher current amplitude to reach the threshold*.\n",
    "    - A sinusoidal waveform provides alternating periods of depolarization and hyperpolarization, which may or may not reach a high enough peak to consistently activate the Na⁺ channels *unless the frequency and amplitude are precisely tuned*.\n",
    "- Comparative Physical Concept: Threshold as Energy Barrier: The concept is analogous to crossing an energy barrier in physics. Just as an object needs enough energy (or momentum) to overcome a barrier, the cell’s membrane potential must exceed a threshold “barrier” to generate an action potential. Different waveforms have distinct \"energy profiles\" over time, influencing their ability to cross this threshold."
